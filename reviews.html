    <h2>What Ous customers Says</h2>
    <p>Are hostels good for students? Absolutely! Living in a hostel teaches time management, financial independence,<br> and social adaptability. It's a space where students grow, explore, and step out of their comfort zones.</p>

                <p>Everything was really good: every space (rooms, kitchen and toilets) were clean at every moment, 
                    the room was comfy and with enough spacethe location was close to the center (a 10 min walk) 
                     and the personal was absolutely helpful about both the hostel itself and any doubt regarding the city.</p>

            <p>The location was very good. All public transports are very close from the hotel. Stuffâ€™s were very nice & helpful. Restaurants are also in front of the hotel.
                 Rooms are very clean.Everyday they cleaned rooms & washrooms. I will always try to book this hotel when I will visit Lisbon .</p>
