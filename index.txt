    <h1>What Ous customers Says</h1>
    <p>Are hostels good for students? Absolutely! Living in a hostel teaches time management, financial independence,<br> and social adaptability. It's a space where students grow, explore, and step out of their comfort zones.</p>

                <p>Everything was really good: every space (rooms, kitchen and toilets) were clean at every moment, 
                    the room was comfy and with enough spacethe location was close to the center (a 10 min walk) 
                     and the personal was absolutely helpful about both the hostel itself and any doubt regarding the city.</p>
